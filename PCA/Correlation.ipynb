    "### Forumula\n",
    "The correlation coefficient is often expressed through the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\rho = \\frac{\\sigma_{X,Y}}{\\sigma_X\\sigma_Y}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum{(x_i - \\mu_X)(y_i-\\mu_Y)}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum{}(x_i-\\mu_X)^2}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum{(y_i-\\mu_Y)^2}}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe this is the case because these values (covariance, std deviation, etc) are traditionally calculated in conjunction and this allows us to reuse that work\n",
    "\n",
    "If we simlify the formula by calcelling out the $1/n$ we would have something like\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\rho=\\frac{\\sum{(x_i - \\mu_X)\\sum(y_i-\\mu_Y)}}{\\sqrt{\\sum{(x_i-\\mu_X)^2}}\\sqrt{\\sum{(y_i-\\mu_Y)^2}}} =  \\frac{\\sum{(x_i - \\mu_X)(y_i-\\mu_Y)}}{\\sqrt{\\sum{(x_i-\\mu_X)^2(y_i-\\mu_Y)^2}}} = \\frac{\\sum d_xd_Y}{\\sqrt{\\sum d_x^2}\\sqrt{\\sum d_y^2}}$$\n",

    "Now lets refer back to the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\rho = \\frac{\\sum d_xd_Y}{\\sqrt{\\sum d_x^2}\\sqrt{\\sum d_y^2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So when we are looking at the numerator $\\sum d_x d_y$ we can see that we are adding areas or rectangles representing the deviation of x and y.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"deviation_two_dimension_geom.png\" alt=\"Two Dimensional Deviation Sum simple\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The denominator $\\sqrt{\\sum d_x^2}\\sqrt{\\sum d_y^2}$ is also an area. This area is intended to represent the maximum possible total deviations of both x and y. This area is calculated by multiplying the total deviations of x by the total deviations of y (ignoring signs).\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting caveat in this calculation is the way that we determine the total deviation for a specific variable. We are using the squaring technique to find the absolute values rather than using the absolute value function. There are a number of overlapping explanations for why this is. The one i will focus on contunies the geometric explanation. We introduce a new dimension when we introduce a new variable. As such the x variable is now related to deviations in two dimensions. If all of the deviations of x are explained by y then, between the two dimensions, we form a square. An important characteristic of the square is that it has the largest area of any rectangle. This means that the squaring of the deviations represent the largest possible area representing the two dimensional deviation. Taking the quare root of this square gives us the optimal length of an arbitrary side.\n",
