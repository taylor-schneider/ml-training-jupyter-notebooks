    "In February 19, 2019, Databricks [announced](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/02/04/introducing-delta-time-travel-for-large-scale-data-lakes.html) the release of the time travel feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "> With this new feature, Delta automatically versions the big data that you store in your data lake, and you can access any historical version of that data. This temporal data management simplifies your data pipeline by making it easy to audit, roll back data in case of accidental bad writes or deletes, and reproduce experiments and reports. Your organization can finally standardize on a clean, centralized,  versioned big data repository in your own cloud storage for your analytics.\n",

    "## Reminders\n",
    "Recall that delta lake is built on top of Apache Spark. Delta lake is the storage layer while Spark is the execution layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such Spark is providing a significant portion of the tech stack one would interact with when using delta lake. We load our data using spark, we transform our data using spark, we are using spark. As such, we must be aware of some of the tools in the spark tool belt that will be relevant to the aspect of time travel. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Spark provides a python api called PySpark. PySpark allows python to communicate with the lower level APIs of the execution layer; specifically the Dataframe API which loads and manipulates dataframes, and the SQL API which allows us to execute SQL queries against dataframes the way we would against traditional sql tables (sits on top of dataframes).\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, to exploit ALL the time travel functionality, there are some things we must do with the spark SQL API. We will point those out as they are encountered."

    "# 1. Challenges Being Addressed\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1. Audit data changes\n",
    "Auditing data changes is critical from both in terms of data compliance as well as simple debugging to understand how data has changed over time. Traditionally the audit was tightly coupled with the pipelines responsible for delivering the data. This feature standardizes the audit regardless of how the data got into the data lake.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Reproduce experiments & reports\n",
    "During model training, data scientists run various experiments with different parameters on a given set of data. When scientists revisit their experiments after a period of time to reproduce the models, typically the source data has been modified by upstream pipelines. Lot of times, they are caught unaware by such upstream data changes and hence struggle to reproduce their experiments. Some scientists and organizations engineer best practices by creating multiple copies of the data, leading to increased storage costs. The same is true for analysts generating reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3. Rollbacks\n",
    "Data pipelines can sometimes write bad data for downstream consumers. This can happen because of issues ranging from infrastructure instabilities to messy data to bugs in the pipeline. For pipelines that do simple appends to directories or a table, rollbacks can easily be addressed by date-based partitioning. With updates and deletes, this can become very complicated, and data engineers typically have to engineer a complex pipeline to deal with such scenarios. This is no longer the case with time travel."

    "As you write into a Delta table or directory, every operation is automatically versioned. And deltalake provides you with an API for accessing data as of a specified timestamp. But how does this work under the hood?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1. A Brief Explanation of what delta lake is and how it works\n",
    "A great video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-zcZvfSUyIhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-zcZvfSUyI) and a complimentary article can be found [here](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/08/21/diving-into-delta-lake-unpacking-the-transaction-log.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "A Delta lake is a collection of directories and delta tables stored in a data lake. As the name suggests, a delta table is a data table composed of deltas; in other words, a delta table is the result of applying a series of transactions to an initial state. We will see that a delta table is not a file, but a carefully managed directory consisting of files representing the transactions and data which compose the delta table. When we load a table into memory we are actually assembling the table from data files stored in the directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, when we perform operations on the delta table (i.e. store a snapshot of the state of a spark dataframe), we see the files in this dirctory are modified. \n",
    "\n",
    "The delta table directory contains several types of files\n",
    "1. Compressed parquet files\n",
    "2. Checksums to validate the parwuet files\n",
    "3. Transaction logs\n",
    "4. Checkpoint files (cached state to improve computational efficiency)\n",
    "\n",
    "The delta table has a log directory which stores json log files which record operations beind performed on the delta table. These operations describe how we transform the data from one state to another state. The operations can be categorized as follows:\n",
    "- update metadata\n",
    "- add parquet file\n",
    "- remove parquet file\n",
    "- set transaction (record idempotent transaction id)\n",
    "- change transaction protocol version\n",
    "\n",
    "This log directory is extremely important because it is what provides the information for calculating versions and of data and their coresponding timestamps. The log directory consists of transaction files, each transaction file pertains to a specific version of data. File '00000000000000000000.json' coresponds to version 0 while file '00000000000000000000.json' coresponds to version 1 of the delta table. Each transaction file has a modified data assigned by the operating system. This timestamp attaches a datatime to our version.\n",

The idea is that this checkpoint provides Spark with a shortcut; rather than parsing all the json files and loading the the coresponding part files sequentiall, is simply loads the parquet file. If subsequent transactions do happen after the snapshot, Spark will filter out the irrelevant logs and only process the transactions occurring after the snapshot.\n",
