Description: # Overview
        This repository hosts a collection of workbooks, sample data, and explanations regarding machine learning and the supporting mathematics, technologies, and processes.
        
        At this point in time I am working exclusively in python. I expect to add additional languages and frameworks as things progress. The intent however is that this matrical can be consumed by anyone independent of any "Vendor lock in". I try to use open source technology and stay in the mainstream wherever possible.
        
        # Getting Started
        This repository is broken down into a number of topics; some of which are overlapping. I try to attack the problem by getting a bird's eye view and then working my way down into the details of specific topics once we get our orientation.
        
        As mentioned earlier, I am working in python 3+. Each notebook list the respective prerequisites.
        
        I have prepared a requirements.txt file to list out the packages and versions I am using. I also provide the setup.py file to install these requirements and the utilities hosted in the *Utilities/* directory.
        
        To see how to use this setup.py file, read the [Environment Setup Notebook](EnvironmentSetup.ipynb)
