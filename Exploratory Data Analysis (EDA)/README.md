# Exploritory Data Analysis
In this directory we have several notebooks releate to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). As the name suggests, EDA is concerned with exploring data. We dont necessarily understand the data and are looking for trends and patterns to help summarize and explain the samples.

We will start by looking at statistics. We can derive descriptive statistics and probability distributions to help explain our data.

I suggest reading the notebooks in the following order:

1. Histograms and Probability
2. Quantiles
3. Normalization
4. Intro to Generalized Lambda Distribution (GLD)
5. Fitting GLD To Sample Data

Once we have the basic statistical explanations we can look at using machine learning to do more advanced discovery work. For example cluster analysis etc.
