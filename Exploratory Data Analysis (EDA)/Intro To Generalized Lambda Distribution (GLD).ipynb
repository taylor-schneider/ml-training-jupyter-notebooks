    "The Generalize Lambda Distribution is a generalized probability distribution. It is a general formula for a probability distribution function. It accepts parameters which allow it to take on almost any shape that a probability distribution might take on. The parameters are expressed as a set of lambdas which is where it gets its name.The GLD can be configured to fit sample data by calculating the lambdas based on the sample data and plugging the values into the equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GLD provides the ability to predict and interpolate values consistent with a probability distribution. This is a very useful feature which is not available with rudimentary techniques such as histograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The history of the development of the GLD is important as it helps understand the different parameter sets and implimentations available. The major challenges in the field have been finding an equation that can assume the full range of posible shapes and finding methods to calculate the parameters. We will see that there are several parameterizations (definitions of the function) that have been developed."
