Additionally, the theorm allows us to update our beliefes recursively. With each new observation there is more evidence to condition our expectations for the next observation.\n",

For example $Y = \\beta _0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2$. We typically refer to these regression coefficients as weights measuring importance. But from a probabalistic mindset, we can think of these coefficients as a relative frequency or probability that the independent variable will impact the dependent variable.\n",

The goal is not to find the best parameters of the model so that we can accurately estimate a given point. Instead the goal is to descern the posterior distribution for the model parameters. Inthis way both the response and parameters are stated in terms of a probability distribution.\n",
