    "Practically speaking the relationships one seeks to describe exists with respect to variables. We are able to express relationships between variables using algebra and in some instances those relationships are linear.\n",

    "We will look at a very simple example which is often referred to as or classified as a linear combination. As the name suggests, the exampls is articulated as a sum or combination of terms and this sum exhibits the property of linearity.\n",

    "For example, consider the following relationship:\n",

    "We will see that in some texts that switching between the conceptualization of linear transform and linear combination are quite common.\n",
