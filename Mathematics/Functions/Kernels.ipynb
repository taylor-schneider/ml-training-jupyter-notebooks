    "To gain some intuition about the meaning and thus reasoning for the choice of the word I came accross this [helpful article](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/500920/word-origin-meaning-of-kernel-in-linear-algebra).\n",
    "\n",
    "The word is originally traced to a reference to the null space of a system. Recall that a system is a mathematical operation $B$ being applied to a set $A$ which results in a set of values $C$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ AB = C $$\n",

    "$$ AB = 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking about the value zero, this is essentially the origin of a uni-dimensional space. Extending this into multiple dimensions, the zero vector is also the origin of a multi-dimensional space.\n",

    "So we can conceptually say that the kernel (null space) contains information about the elements of the domain which map to the origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the origin of euclidean space is our frame of reference. It is the central point which implicitly or explicitly gives meaning to all the other values of the domain and the operation. As such the origin is a primary point of interest whether intentionally acknowledged or not. All other measurements are based on the origin by default because of it's mathematical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going a step further, the elements of the domain are going through an transformation operation and mapping to a transformed space. Some of these elements of the domain map to the origin of the transformed space, some do not. \n",
    "\n",
    "As such we can construct a relationship between the these sets of points to orient ourselves with respect to the transformed space. It may be the subject of interest to see how these raw domain points are related with respect to the transformed origin. It may also be computationally more efficient to work in the domain space rather than the transformed space.\n",

    "Thinking about this in reverse, the kernel contains information about this central point of interest and how it can be transformed into an arbitrary domain (via inverse transformation).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see that as the mathematical field changes the \"point of interest\" may change. But generally speaking the kernel is still an operation/transformation that informs a relationship between a point of interest and a given domain."
