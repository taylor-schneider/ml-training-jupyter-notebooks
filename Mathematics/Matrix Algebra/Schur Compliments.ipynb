    "The Schur Compliment can be thought of in several ways. It can be thought of as a mathematical property of a matrix. In other words, one can find the Schur Compliment of a matrix. Another way of thinking about it is that a matrix is a Schur Complimnt if it can be decomponsed into a specific structure.\n",
