Tihs folder contains information related to eigenvalues and eigenvectors

It is reccomended that the notebooks/documentation be read in the following order:
1. [Introduction To Eigenvalues And Eigenvectors](../../Mathematics/Matrix%20Algebra/Eigenvalues%20And%20Eigenvectors/Introduction%20To%20Eigenvalues%20And%20Eigenvectors.md)
2. [Intuition Behind Eigen-Decomposition](../../Mathematics/Matrix%20Algebra/Eigenvalues%20And%20Eigenvectors/Intuition%20Behind%20Eigen-Decomposition.ipynb)

While creating the related notebooks, I wanted to do some sanity checks to make sure the eigenvalues/eigenvectors behaved the way they should. I was new to matrix algebra and numpy/pandas so I wanted to verify my code was written the way the math was written. We can see a few examples of using numpy to do proofs in [this notebook](Numpy%20Eigen-decomposition%20Proof%20Check.ipynb)
