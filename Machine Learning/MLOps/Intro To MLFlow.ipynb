    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the [homepage](https://mlflow.org/) MLFlow is \"An open source platform for the machine learning lifecycle\". Its intended purpose is to provide a single tool which allows data scientists to address ML specific components of the Software Development Life cycle (SDLC) including: experimentation, reproducibility, model deployment, and a model storage in a centralizing model registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project breaks down into the following sub-components:\n",
    "- MLflow Tracking - Allows user to record and query experiments: code, data, config, and results\n",
    "- MLflow Projects - A standard package format allowing reproducable deployments of models to any platform regardless of where they were authored\n",
    "- MLflow Models - A unified abstraction layer allowing support for integration with multiple machine learning model libraries and providers\n",
    "- Model Registry - Store, annotate, discover, and manage models in a central repository\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see that each sub-component has a coresponding UI and API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project page boasts integrations with many big name players, providers, and technology stacks and sees contributions coming from many big names in the space."

    "# 1. Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started with MLFlow, It is important to understand the architectural components. As we will see in section 2, there are a number of ways to deploy the MLFlow. Before we choose a method, it is important to understand that an MLFlow deployment consists of the following components:\n",
    "- Backend - Persists MLflow entities (runs, parameters, metrics, tags, notes, metadata, etc)\n",
    "- Artifact Store - persists artifacts (files, models, images, in-memory objects, or model summary, etc)\n",
    "- REST API - The optional component exposing web based MLFlow API\n",
    "- Tracking UI - The Web UI for lets you visualize, search and compare runs, as well as download run artifacts or metadata for analysis in other tools, and register or tag models.\n",
