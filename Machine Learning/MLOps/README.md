# Overview

In this directory, We have information related to **MLOps**. MLOps is the machine learning equivalent of DevOps; which is the combination of development and operations practices. MLOps puts an ML spin on the established conventions. While we are still worried about CI/CD, IaC, Configuration Management, and declarative manifests, we are also worried about integrating our machine learning lifecycles as first class citizens.

# Brief History

From what I can tell, the concept started becoming popular around 2018 as machine learning was becoming main stream. In June 2018, Databricks (a self described data and AI company) [announced the release of MLFlow](https://www.mlflow.org/category/news/index.html); a tool specifically built to address the nuances of MLOps. Later in april 2020, [AWS announces it's SageMaker notebooks](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/04/announcing-general-availability-amazon-sagemaker-notebooks/) and shortly after several competing products.

# Technologies

There are a number of componets that go into DevOps and thus MLOps. In this project we will try to focus on those strictly related to ML wherever possible. The technologies we focus on include:

- git
- MLFlow by Databricks
- Deltalake by Databricks
