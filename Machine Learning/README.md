# Overview

Machine Learning is a broad field of applied sciences. There are a lot of overlaps and a long history that intertwines many disciplines.

In this directory we have notebooks related to several topics. Our goal is to establish a broad view of ML topics.

- Algorithms - In this directory we explore the various classifications of algorithms and how they can be used
- AutoML - We look at the frameworks providing end to end automation of the machine learning workflow
- Big Data And Big Compute - We look at the tools for handling the big problems given finite resources
- MLOps - We look at operationalizing the ML workflow and establishing crossfunctional teams and a governance model
