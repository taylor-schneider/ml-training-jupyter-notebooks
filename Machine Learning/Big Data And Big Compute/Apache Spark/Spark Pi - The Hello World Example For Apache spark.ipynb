    "# 1. The Spark Pi Problem\n",
    "We are going to run the Spark Pi example which uses a \"Monte Carlo Method\" and the \"Circle Method\" to approximate the value of pi. \n",
    "In short; We will generate a large number or random points within a unit square and determine the ratio of the points within the unit circle; This will give us an approximation for the value of pi.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the area of a circle is defined as:\n",
    "$$ A_c = \\pi r^2 $$\n",
    "Considering we are dealing with a unit circle, we have $r = 0.5$, and therfore\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A_c = 0.5^2 \\pi  = 0.25\\pi = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$$\n",
    "Recall that the area of a square is defined as:\n",
    "$$ A_s = l^2 = 1^2 = 1 $$\n",
    "If we divide the area of the circle (smaller) by the area of the square (larger) we have the following equality:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{A_c}{A_s} = \\frac{\\pi / 4}{1} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$$\n",
    "And therefore we can say:\n",
    "$$ \\pi = 4 \\frac{A_c}{A_s} $$\n",
    "With this equation we can derive the value of pi using the area of the circle and the square.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can approximate the ratio of these areas using a set of random numbers and a bit of logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we generate uniform random variables we can treat them as points on a discrete grid.\n",
    "The number of grid points that fall in the circle compared to the total number of points approximates the ratio of the area of the circle and the square respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{num \\ points \\ in  \\ circle}{num \\ of \\ points} \\approx \\frac{A_c}{A_s} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "As the number of random points increases, we converge to the true areas and thus the true value of pi.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src='images/Convergence of Monte Carlo.gif' width=\"300px\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can determine which poitns are inside the circle vs the ones that are not by using the Pythagorean Theorem.\n",
    "Given a triangle, we can determine the length of a side if we know the length of the other two sides.\n",
    "$$ A^2 + B^2 = C^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C = \\sqrt{A^2 + B^2} $$\n",
    "If we compare the hypotinuse with the radius of a circle we will be able to determine whether or not a point is within a circle or not\n",

    "$$ r \\le \\sqrt{X^2 + Y^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are dealing with a unit circle, $r = 1; \\sqrt{1} = 1$ , thus we can also say:\n",
