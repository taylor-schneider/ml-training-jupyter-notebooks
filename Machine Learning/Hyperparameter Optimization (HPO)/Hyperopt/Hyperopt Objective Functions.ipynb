    "As stated earlier, the objective function is responsible for evaluating the \"goodness\" or \"performance\" of a model or function when it is provided with a particular parameter set. This is sometimes referred to as a loss function within the machine learning space. The evaluation is provided as a globally comparable metric or measurement (some type of number).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "metric = objective(parameter_set)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining this measure is outside the scope of this notebook. At a high level, the function might be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def objective(parameters_set):\n",
    "\n",
    "    // Create a machine learning model\n",
    "    // Train the model\n",
    "    // Test the model\n",
    "    // return test results metric\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For educational purposed we will consider a trivial measure. Our objective function will return a number representing the sum of the sample parameters it was provided from the search space. For example, consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "metric = objective(0)\n",
    "# metric == 0\n",
    "\n",
    "metric = objective(1,2,3)\n",
    "# metric == 6\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated earlier, defining the objective function depends on the search space. If the schema of the search space changes, so must the objective function. As we go through our examples, we will see the objective function's definition change to fit our search space."
