# Exploritory Data Analysis
In this directory we have several notebooks releate to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). As the name suggests, EDA is concerned with exploring data. We dont necessarily understand the data and are looking for trends and patterns to help summarize and explain the samples.

First we will look at normalization techniques. These techniques allow us to compare datasets which seem dissimilar.

1. Normalization

Nest we will look at descriptive statistics which help quantify the way data is sitributed. Specifically we will look at **density** measurements which allow us to quantify how data is grouped or distributed.

2. [Histograms](Histograms.ipynb)
3. [Quantiles](Quantiles.ipynb)

Density measurements can be used to approximate probability distributions allow us to make quantitative statements about how likely it is for a value to be observed in the future. There are many techniques for approximating probability distributions based on sample data.

3. [Density and Probability](Density%20and%20Probability.ipynb)
4. [Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)](Kernel%20Density%20Estimation%20%28KDE%29.ipynb)

Some PDF estimation techniques do not require using an intermediary density measuremens.

5. [Intro to Generalized Lambda Distribution (GLD)](Intro%20to%20Generalized%20Lambda%20Distribution%20%28GLD%29.ipynb)
6. [Fitting GLD To Sample Data](Fitting%20GLD%20To%20Sample%20Data.ipynb)

Once we have the basic statistical explanations of our data we can look at using machine learning to do more advanced discovery work. For example cluster analysis etc.
