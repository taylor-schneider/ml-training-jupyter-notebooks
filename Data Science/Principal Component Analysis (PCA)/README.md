# Overview
In this notebook we explore the concept of Principal Component Analysis. This technique is a powerful tool which is typically used for dimentionality reduction. PCA will try to measure the importance of a feature by measuring the variance that the variable introduces into the system. We then minimize the number of factors selected while maximizing the amount of variance preserved by the selected factors.
