# Overview
This repository hosts a collection of workbooks, sample data, and explanations regarding machine learning and the supporting mathematics, technologies, and processes.

At this point in time I am working exclusively in python. I expect to add additional languages and frameworks as things progress. The intent however is that this matrical can be consumed by anyone independent of any "Vendor lock in". I try to use open source technology and stay in the mainstream wherever possible.

# Getting Started
This repository is broken down into a number of topics; some of which are overlapping. I try to attack the problem by getting a bird's eye view and then working my way down into the details of specific topics once we get our orientation.

As mentioned earlier, I am working in python 3+. Each notebook list the respective prerequisites.

Following this train of thought, I suggest reviewing the materials in the following order:

- Overview Of The Machine Learning
- Define Problem and Solution Requirements
- Identify Data Sources and Data Structure
- Extract Transform and Load (ETL)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Choose And Calibrate A Model
- Make Predictions
- Evaluate And Adjust (EDA ->)
