# Overview
This repository hosts a collection of workbooks, sample data, and explanations regarding machine learning and the supporting mathematics, technologies, and processes.

At this point in time I am working exclusively in python. I expect to add additional languages (such as R or matlab) and frameworks as things progress. The intent however is that this matrical can be consumed by anyone independent of any "Vendor lock in". I try to use open source technology and stay in the mainstream wherever possible.

# Getting Started
This repository is broken down into a number of topics; some of which are overlapping. I try to attack the problem by getting a bird's eye view first and then working my way down into the details of specific topics once we get our orientation (This is a breath first search as opposed to depth first search).

If you are brand new to ML and want to put hands on keyboard I would suggest consuming the materials in the following order:
- [Foundational Data Structures](Data%20Engineering/Foundational%20Data%20Structures/Introduction%20To%20Python%20Data%20Structures%20For%20Data%20Science.ipynb) - Without this we cannot do anything without data structures

-[Machine Learning]() - Looking at the algorithms with hands on keyboard.

## Installing Required Libraries

As mentioned earlier, I am working in python 3+. Each notebook lisst the respective prerequisites.

I have prepared a requirements.txt file to list out the packages and versions I am using. I also provide the setup.py file to install these requirements and the utilities hosted in the *Utilities/* directory.

To see how to use this setup.py file, read the [Environment Setup Notebook](EnvironmentSetup.ipynb)
